## What is Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant?

Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant is a service to enhance the creation of Red Hat Ansible automation.  Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant uses, among other data, Ansible roles and collections that are available through the community website, [Ansible Galaxy][galaxy]. The following provides some answers to questions you may have related specifically to Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant.

## Do you match Recommendations to Training Data?

Given the nature of deep learning technology, as well as the kinds of content used to train and
which are generated, it is not possible to identify specific training data inputs that contributed to
particular output recommendations. Nevertheless, Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code
Assistant includes a feature to help users that are interested in understanding possible origins of
generated content recommendations. When Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant
generates a recommendation, it will attempt to find items in the training dataset that closely
resemble the recommendation. In such cases, Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant
will display licensing information and a source repository link for the training data matches in a
panel interface in the VS Code extension. Licensing information is determined using the [GitHub license API][gh-lince-api].

This feature may enable users to ascertain open source license terms that are
associated with related training data. We have implemented this feature even though we believe
it is unlikely that either the training data used in fine-tuning or the output recommendations
themselves are generally protected by copyright, or that output reproduces training data content
controlled by copyright licensing terms.

## Does Red Hat assert rights in the suggestions generated by the Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant service?

Red Hat does not claim any copyright or other intellectual property rights in the suggestions generated by the Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant service.

## Is my final Ansible content created from the suggestions in VS Code editor used as feedback to the Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant service and may I opt out of providing feedback?

Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant is designed to be improved through feedback on
the quality of its suggestions. Technical details of user experiences with Ansible Lightspeed with
Watson Code Assistant can be useful in informing further improvements. For example, identifying
which Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant suggestions has been accepted by the
user, noting particular details that the user has needed to adjust, etc.

This feedback is obtained by way of the Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant VS Code extension and is used to improve the Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant service.

## How do I provide general feedback?
The Ansible VS Code extension links a sentiment survey which we encourage you to complete as
you test the Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant service. To access the survey, click
“Lightspeed” on the right-hand side of the VS Code status bar and click “Take Survey”.

After completing the survey, you have the opportunity to provide general feedback. You also can
contact us in the [Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant Matrix room: `#ansible-lightspeed:ansible.com`][matrix-room].

## What information is sent from VS Code to train the model?
Personal information in the telemetry data is removed and anonymized before being sent to train
the model. The telemetry data includes, but is not limited to the following:

* A session and activity ID is used to correlate the telemetry data.
* Information on whether the recommendation was ignored, modified, or accepted.
* The Ansible playbook content in which the recommendation was generated. Potential sensitive information is first removed.
* The Ansible playbook file name.

## What data sources are used to train the Watson Code Assistant model?
The Watson Code Assistant model gathers training data from Ansible Galaxy, GitHub, and other
open sources of data. Ansible Galaxy users can opt-out of their Ansible Galaxy namespaces that
can be used to train the Watson Code Assistant model. Please refer to the Contributing section in
this document for more information on Ansible Galaxy.

## How long will it take before I see my feedback improving the model?
Training the Watson Code Assistant model with the telemetry data is resource-intensive. IBM
Research intends to retrain the model at a cadence allowing noticeable model improvements
between model versions.

## How do we address potentially sensitive information in telemetry data?
The Ansible VS Code extension does not collect personal user information. Ansible-related data,
such as Ansible playbook content, is anonymized. Potentially sensitive information, such as
identifiable personal information, credentials, or key information, is removed before being sent to
train the model.

## I need more help. Where can I go?
The Ansible VS Code extension provides a Contact Us link on the right-hand side of VS Code
Status bar. To send an email via the Contact Us button, click on Lightspeed and then on the
Contact Us button.
