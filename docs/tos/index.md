## IBM Watson Code Assistant Terms of Service

We are excited that you are interested in participating in this Tech Preview and as a benefit, receiving access to IBM’s Early Cloud Service for Watson Code Assistant (“Early Cloud Service” or “ECS.”)  User may use the ECS at no cost subject to the terms of this Agreement (“Agreement”).

BY USING THE ECS, USER SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE AGREEMENT TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE AGREEMENT TERMS, THEN DO NOT USE THE ECS.

### 1. Early Cloud Service

The Tech Preview gives access to a pre-release version of the ECS. The ECS is intended to use an AI model to create Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content, and share related data and information regarding such usage to train and improve the ECS.  

Suggestions by ECS:  Based on your request, the ECS will provide suggested Ansible tasks and other Ansible materials (“Suggestions”). By using the ECS, you agree that any and all Suggestions and any User data input into ECS may be used by International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) and its affiliates including Red Hat, Inc. (“Red Hat”), for any purpose without limitation, including to further improve and train the ECS.  

Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model used to provide the ECS. The Suggestions will likely require modifications by User. User should evaluate whether Suggestions are appropriate for User environments. User’s use of Suggestions is at User’s discretion and risk. Any User requests or input into ECS will not be treated as confidential information.  

The ECS is not designed to comply with any specific governmental regulation or specific security measures. User agrees that no personal data will be input to the ECS, including such that may be subject to European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requirements.  User acknowledges that the use of the ECS meets User's requirements and processing instructions required to comply with applicable laws.

User Feedback on ECS:  The ECS is a service IBM is developing and testing for release as a cloud service. User is authorized to use the ECS for the purpose of evaluating its functionality and to provide feedback on the ECS to IBM and its affiliates, who may use the feedback for any purpose without limitation.  

Code:  Code is defined as the content User creates using the ECS, including User’s modifications to Suggestions. IBM does not claim any intellectual property rights with respect to any Suggestions.

These Program Terms govern your use of the Services and are subject to the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement available at [https://www.redhat.com/agreements][agreements] (collectively the **"Agreement"**). When we use a capitalized term without defining it in these Program Terms, the term has the meaning defined in the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement. If there is a conflict between these Program Terms and the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement, the Program Terms will take precedence.

The Program gives access to a preview version of the Service. The Service uses an AI model to create Ansible tasks, playbooks and other Ansible related content, and shares that data and related information regarding such usage to train and improve the Service. The Service is not supported for or intended for any other purpose.

To use the Service, you need to install the Ansible Visual Studio Code extension and authenticate via your GitHub account that you have been authorized to use with the Service. Based on your request, the Service will provide suggested tasks, playbooks or other Ansible related materials (**"Suggestions"**).  By using the Service, you agree that any and all Suggestions and any data associated with the Service, may be used by Red Hat and Red Hat’s affiliated companies, including IBM, for any purpose including to further improve and train the Service. Additional details related to the type of information collected are provided in the Service documentation.

Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model used to provide the Service.  The Suggestions will likely require additional modifications by you to be useful. Suggestions are not considered Red Hat Software and Red Hat does not claim any intellectual property rights with respect to any Suggestions. Your use of Suggestions is at your discretion and risk.  Any requests or input into the Service will not be treated as confidential information. The Service is not intended to process personal information, so do not provide personal information as part of the Service except for business contact type information (name, work email address, etc.) associated with this Program.
