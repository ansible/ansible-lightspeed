## IBM Watson Code Assistant Terms of Service

We are excited that you are interested in participating in this Tech Preview and as a benefit, receiving access to IBM’s Early Cloud Service for Watson Code Assistant (“Early Cloud Service” or “ECS.”)  User may use the ECS at no cost subject to the terms of this Agreement (“Agreement”).

**BY USING THE ECS, USER SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE AGREEMENT TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE AGREEMENT TERMS, THEN DO NOT USE THE ECS.**

### 1. Early Cloud Service

The Tech Preview gives access to a pre-release version of the ECS. The ECS is intended to use an AI model to create Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content, and share related data and information regarding such usage to train and improve the ECS.  

Suggestions by ECS:  Based on your request, the ECS will provide suggested Ansible tasks and other Ansible materials (“Suggestions”). By using the ECS, you agree that any and all Suggestions and any User data input into ECS may be used by International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) and its affiliates including Red Hat, Inc. (“Red Hat”), for any purpose without limitation, including to further improve and train the ECS.  

Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model used to provide the ECS. The Suggestions will likely require modifications by User. User should evaluate whether Suggestions are appropriate for User environments. User’s use of Suggestions is at User’s discretion and risk. Any User requests or input into ECS will not be treated as confidential information.  

The ECS is not designed to comply with any specific governmental regulation or specific security measures. User agrees that no personal data will be input to the ECS, including such that may be subject to European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requirements.  User acknowledges that the use of the ECS meets User's requirements and processing instructions required to comply with applicable laws.

User Feedback on ECS:  The ECS is a service IBM is developing and testing for release as a cloud service. User is authorized to use the ECS for the purpose of evaluating its functionality and to provide feedback on the ECS to IBM and its affiliates, who may use the feedback for any purpose without limitation.

## Red Hat Terms of Service

**Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM Watson Code Assistant Technical Preview Program Terms**

We are excited that you are interested in participating in this Technical Preview Program (**“Program”**) and as a benefit, receiving access to Red Hat’s preview service that provides guidance on Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content (**“Lightspeed”**) integrated with IBM’s Early Cloud Service for Watson Code Assistant ("ECS") (subject to a separate IBM agreement). The Program gives you access to a preview version of Lightspeed at no cost subject to these terms.  

These Program Terms govern your use of Lightspeed and are subject to the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement available at http://www.redhat.com/agreements (the **"Agreement"**). When we use a capitalized term without defining it in these Program Terms, the term has the meaning defined in the Agreement. If there is a conflict between these Program Terms and the Agreement, the Program Terms will take precedence. IBM is not a party to the Agreement or these Program Terms.

The Program gives access to a preview version of Lightspeed. Lightspeed passes your requests to ECS and uses output from ECS to refine Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content. Red Hat shares that data and related information regarding such usage with IBM to train and improve Lightspeed and ECS. Lightspeed is not supported for or intended for any other purpose.

To use Lightspeed, you need to install the Ansible Visual Studio Code extension and authenticate via your GitHub account that you have been authorized to use for this Program. Based on your request, Lightspeed will provide suggested tasks or other Ansible related materials (**"Suggestions"**). By participating in this Program you agree that any and all Suggestions and any data associated with your use, may be used by Red Hat and Red Hat’s affiliated companies, including IBM, for any purpose including to further improve and train Lightspeed and ECS. The following information is collected and may be shared with IBM:

The VS Code extension provides prompts and context to create Suggestions, and user interactions with Suggestions such as acceptance, modification or rejection.
Lightspeed collects telemetry including Suggestions generated by ECS and refined by post-processing rules, as well as operational information (e.g. service errors and response times).

User feedback regarding user sentiment and recommendations.
Any program feedback provided directly to Red Hat.

Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model. The Suggestions will likely require additional modifications by you to be useful. Suggestions are not considered Red Hat Software and Red Hat does not claim any intellectual property rights with respect to any Suggestions. Your use of Suggestions is at your discretion and risk. Any requests or input into Lightspeed will not be treated as confidential information. Lightspeed is not intended to process personal information, so do not provide personal information except for business contact type information (name, work email address, etc.) associated with this Program. For information on how Red Hat processes your personal information, see the Red Hat Privacy Statement.

Red Hat makes no warranties or guarantees with respect to Lightspeed including Suggestions, except those explicitly required by law, and you should confirm that use of Lightspeed or any Suggestions is appropriate for your environment. If you believe Red Hat or its affiliates are using your material in a non-compliant manner, you agree to provide Red Hat with written notice and allow Red Hat ninety days to address your issue.

Red Hat reserves the right to periodically update, improve or discontinue Lightspeed or any component or functionality at any time. Red Hat may terminate your use of Lightspeed at any time for any reason.  

These Program Terms establish the rights and obligations associated with Lightspeed and are not intended to limit your rights to software code under the terms of an open source license.
