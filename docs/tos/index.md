These Program Terms govern your use of the Services and are subject to the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement available at [https://www.redhat.com/agreements][agreements] (collectively the **"Agreement"**). When we use a capitalized term without defining it in these Program Terms, the term has the meaning defined in the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement. If there is a conflict between these Program Terms and the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement, the Program Terms will take precedence.

The Program gives access to a preview version of the Service. The Service uses an AI model to create Ansible tasks, playbooks and other Ansible related content, and shares that data and related information regarding such usage to train and improve the Service. The Service is not supported for or intended for any other purpose.

Red Hat intends to offer the Program through July, 2023 and reserves the right to periodically update, improve or discontinue the Service or any component or functionality of the Service. Red Hat may terminate your use of the Service at any time for any reason.
