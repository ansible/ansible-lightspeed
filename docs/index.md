# Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant

Ansible Lightspeed with Watson Code Assistant is a joint project between IBM and Red Hat that
offers access to Ansible content recommendations through the use of natural language
automation descriptions. This project is accessible through the integration of an IBM AI cloud
service operated by Red Hat and the Ansible VSCode plugin, and is offered to the Ansible
community to use, without cost. This service uses, among other data, roles and collections that
are available through the community website, [Ansible Galaxy][galaxy].
