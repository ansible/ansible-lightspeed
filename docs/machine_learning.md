## Model training

Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant models are trained by IBM using techniques for foundational model technology, and then the models are used by Red Hat.  

IBM and Red Hat intend to refresh the model at a cadence of once-per-month. That objective does not guarantee a new model in a certain time frame, but both organizations intend to refresh the model on a regular basis for model quality improvement.
